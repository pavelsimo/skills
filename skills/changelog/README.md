# changelog skill

A skill for agents that generates `CHANGELOG.md` entries from git history and cuts versioned releases following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) conventions.

## Usage

```
/changelog                    # entries from commits since last versioned release
/changelog 2025-04-01         # entries from commits since a specific date
/changelog 2025-04-01..HEAD   # entries from an explicit range
/changelog --release 1.2.0    # promote [Unreleased] to a versioned section
```

The assistant reads your git history, translates technical commits into user-facing prose, and shows a preview of every change before writing anything.

## Changelog Format

Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- stream responses from the /v1/chat endpoint

## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-01

### Fixed
- crash when uploading files over 100 MB

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v1.1.0...HEAD
[1.1.0]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0
```
